An application for searching up information regarding a variety of cocktails.

The user can input full names or search based on the first letter of a cocktail 
and the application returns ingredients and recipies for each cocktail.


I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to create a responsive design thats 
easy to interface with.

I looked into the contents of the API to decide what I wanted the app to offer.

I broke down the website into three sections that handled different aspects of the 
user interface. A search function that was easy to use, the main content sections that 
displayed the images of the cocktails, that you can click on and then display information.
And a footer that contained simple isntructions for how to sue the website.

I had a bit of trouble with the repsonsive design aspect of the project, sizing everything and getting 
chrome to recognize my media queries.
